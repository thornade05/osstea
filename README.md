A Decentralized Protocol for Open-Source Developers to Capture the Value They Create
The tea Protocol is a decentralized technology framework secured by reputation and incentives that enables open-source developers & maintainers to be rewarded for their software contributions.
The modern-day Internet is predominantly composed of open-source projects and has been since its inception. Open-source projects are developed and maintained via collaboration amongst global developer communities, and their codebases are made available for anyone to utilize as a public good. In the past 71 years (it is generally believed that the first example of free and open-source software was released in 1953), open-source software has evolved from the product of niche technology hobbyists to the infrastructure upon which all innovation has been built. Despite the importance of open-source software, the developers that create and maintain the codebase as a public utility receive no fungible rewards for their immense contribution as innovators and maintainers.
